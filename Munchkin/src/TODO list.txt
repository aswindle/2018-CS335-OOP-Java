Things that need doing:

GUI:
  TextField to get player's name needs to be placed somewhere, and the button to start the game needs to get the field.
  
  DEBUG UI:  "Set Card" button needs to get wired up to get the card slot from the rbSlotx radiobuttons (see comments in relevant code section).
              

	Buttons needed: 
	  -Start button needs to create the game object after verifying that the player has typed something in (not an empty string) to the tfGetPlayerName textfield.
	  
		-Cards; only need to be clickable during the selection scene described below; might just work as labels in the main scene
		
		-Miscellaneous actions during turn:
			-Sell
			-Equip item
			-Change Race
			-Change Class

		-Die; only needed in Combat run away scene I think?

	Scenes needed:
		-Main display
		
		-Reusable scene that asks the user to pick n cards from either their Door or Treasure hands, returns them as an ArrayList<Card>; probably needs to have a confirmation button of some kind
			Used for:
				Combat: equipping any items
				Combat: discarding cards for bonuses
				Combat: discarding all for Wizard spell; probably better just to be a single button "Discard All"
				Game: selecting a monster for "Look for Trouble"
				Game: selecting 1 or 2 treasures for curses 1 and 2
				Game: select a new race for curse 5; special case, can use a list of 3 Race cards instead of Door or Treasure hands
				Game: selling cards for a level
				Game: discard phase
				
		-Combat
			-Pre-fight
			-Runaway rolling/rerolling

	-Feedback field to describe what's going on in the game at any moment

	-Hook up buttons to methods
		Possibly incorporate the Game file into the JavaFX file so all of the pieces are accessible to the GUI?

Code:
	Combat:
		-Equipping items before fighting; maybe it should be separated out into Game class?
		-I think I did the discarding for bonus stuff right, but in the wrong spot. Maybe it needs to be separated out into a separate method?
		-Wizard needs to be able to choose from options

	Game:
		-Adding in the text for the feedback field as comments in the appropriate sections so we know what to display in the GUI
